Instead, they marked the charge disputed and cancelled my prime. When I contacted them again to find out what was going on, they said I had to sign up for prime again! They sent a link, I clicked the link, I signed up for Prime again at a huge price increase. Won't keep their word to fix the price, blamed it on me: guess I don't have Prime anymore as they wanted.",

Getting to purchases and account settings is far more confusing than it used to be. Still no dark mode in 2025! So when I open the app at night I'm blinded no matter how dim my screen is.",

My package has been out for delivery for 4 days and has no sign of arriving at my house yet. Every attempt I have with getting in contact in the past couple of hours has been hit with AI. There is no sign of actual people able to help. I don't usually have trouble so this is out of the blue. I hope Amazon adds a feature where you can chat with actual people in the future and breaks out of the AI trend.",

And the last time I bought the exact same set was weeks ago. It says the limits are to stop resellers and for fairness. How is it fair for purchases to be limited?",

Delivery is NEVER when it's supposed to be. Same day items seem to always be delivered the next day, regardless of how much you spend or how early you order. Just waiting on a direct competitor to arrive and knock down this beast that's grown too big for its britches. Can't figure who's worse: Amazon or YouTube. They both stink on ice.",

Amazon’s customer service is useless—they give you different answers every time, ignore you on the phone, keep you on hold forever, and even told me I was “wasting my time.” The stress they caused gave me a panic attack. Absolutely disgusting. I rarely write reviews, but my recent experience with Amazon treatment has been the worst. Do better, Amazon.",

The 'Inspire' function is also garbage and should be able to be disabled. It really isn't that complicated to just allow a person to pull up the app, search or browse products and order without a bunch of nonsense functionality. So much junk on Amazon now. Almost should just rebrand as Temu Jr. While I do like the convenience, they really need to be more selective in the brands",
