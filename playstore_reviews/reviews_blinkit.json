I've faced several issues with Blinkit, including unprofessional behavior from delivery agents who refuse to own up to their mistakes, as well as receiving incorrect information from customer service. I was promised an instant refund, but now they've canceled my order and stated the refund will take 3 to 5 working days. I strongly advise others to be cautious when considering their services.",

Orders usually take 15-20 mins to come. The layout of the app makes it easier to add Items , you can simply go to the section and add. Ordered many times, till now there has been no issue with missed or wrong product. I hope they maintain the same performance as the app is helping many.",

            "content": "I used to use this app almost everyday until I saw a youtube video by Traya Health on the exploitation of Blinkit employees in making 8min delivery possible. It made complete sense. My eyes have been opened. It's completely unacceptable. 99% of the time we don't even need the stuff urgently - it's like regular grocery only. There should be an option to pick a slot for delivery, like on Bigbasket or Licious. Until that's not there, I'm deleting this app. I cannot take part in this human abuse.",
