There is a complete lack of communication after making the reservation, with no updates or confirmations provided. Then, out of nowhere, the trek organizer sends a message stating that the booking has been canceled. This kind of last-minute cancellation without prior notice is highly unprofessional and disappointing. If you're planning an adventure, it's best to book directly with reliable trek organizers !!!",
