I accidentally placed an order while trying to use Swiggy Instamart, and there was no option to cancel the order even though it had just been placed. I contacted customer support within seconds, but they still charged a 100% cancellation fee. This is extremely unfair! Other instant delivery apps give at least a 1-minute window to cancel orders, but Swiggy doesn’t care about the customer’s side at all. Very disappointing and not customer friendly at all.",

When I tried reaching out for help, the support section simply acknowledged the issue with a “thank you” and closed it off, stating there was nothing that could be done. To make matters worse, customer support appears to be fully automated, with no way to speak to an actual person to resolve genuine issues. This is extremely disappointing.",

After waiting for more than 1 hour and numerous calls and promise to deliver, they directly cancelled the order and even after being a paid member. I want a full refund of my membership fee. worst part is they dont have customer support, its only a bot with canned answers, no way to speak to someone and get status or resolve the issue. horrible service. If I cancel, you charge me, then if you cancel after 1 hour, you should to pay a penalty",

They cheated me first by accepting the order for the item which was out of stock and then not refunding the amount after several requests through emails (you can't call them). After few minutes of placing the order, which was prepaid, a swiggy telecaller informed me about the non availability of the item and assured me that the amount would be refunded. Now they are simply refuting the refund and passing the blame to the restaurant. This is no less than an organised fraud.",

So I visited the restaurant as it was nearby (within 2 kms) and brought the same items which cost me just 1480. I saved around 1000 rs by not ordering via the food delivery app. It's unbelievable that it would make such a huge difference in the amount. Loot hai bhai.. loot hai..",

My brother accidently ordered some food and within some seconds I tried to cancel the order, but this scandalous app doesn't show the option to cancel the order even if you try to do it within seconds, when I reached out to thier representative they were constantly forcing me to purchase the food or to pay the same amount as fine to them. Thier customer support is so pathetic and cunning that they give zero value for thier customer. Will never use their app again.",

Please wait just 3 to 4 more minutes.\" However, I had to wait for another hour before I finally received my order. This was extremely frustrating.

And the fun part is the app shows all the time that 'the delivery is on time'. Instamart showed 16 minutes to deliver but it took the delivery guy to reach the location 1 hour and then also not picking up the phone, neither reaching the door steps. Had to cancel my order.

I clearly told them it wasn’t mine, yet it was marked as cancelled and a charge was added to my account. I spent nearly 2 hours on chat support explaining the issue to both an agent and a senior—no proper help. I even emailed them, but got the same response.After all this, I’m still being held responsible for something I didn’t even order. Extremely frustrating and disappointing experience.",

Your money is gone and you time (while sending emails to them and calling them) will be lost. They did not deliver one item in my Instamart order that I URGENTLY needed. I didn't get any refund either. Already very pissed with the behaviour. Kindly tell your delivery agents to share with you a photo of the order they deliver before delivering you idiots.",

The ETA now changed to 60 minutes. They've removed the option to cancel the order in 60 seconds and if you try to cancel the order via customer supporr they'll tell you the order can be cancelled but the entire order value will be forfeited as cancellation fee. Lesson: Never order on Swiggy. If you have to, don't pay before delivery.",

When I raised the issue, Swiggy refused to provide any refund and took zero accountability, even though i also shared all the images of the food. Their customer service is terrible—robotic replies with no real resolution or concern for the customer experience. Order ID: 205826630275391 — avoid going through the same frustration.

My 35-40 minute order did not arrive after almost 90 minutes, post which I reached out to an executive on chat. Supremely unhelpful, because the 'executive' was likely a bot. Very creepy conversation. Issue was resolved with a cancellation and refund, but if I'm asking to speak to someone please don't send me to another bot.",

I have Swiggy one membership despite you change membership benefits without any notice. Increase Instamart minimum order rs 99 to 199, funny part my other number which don't have Swiggy one membership have same 99rs delivery. even on my father's number it's same 99. In food as well, promised time may different, but saying 10min delivery and delivered in 40min not justified.",

I had order from hotel in Pune and waiting for more than 30 mins without any update. when I called Delivery partner, he told that hotel is having some issues and order will be delayed by an hour. When I cancelled the order, they have charged me complete amount for the mistake from a hotel.it's not about the money but Swiggy should have understand who was the culprit here. When I called Care they said, they can't help",
