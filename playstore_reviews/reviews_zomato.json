Thanks to these incorrigible idiots, my food takes 1hr to deliver. And after wanting to speak to an executive atleast 6 times, the stupid bot isn't able to connect me to one and offers to cancel my order. This is after waiting for a full 45 mins.

You're adding so many features from the New York app, which is fine, but when we try to talk to customer support, all we get is this useless AI repeating the same garbage messages over and over! It's the most frustrating experience I've ever had. You need to have real people available to talk to us instead of this ridiculous AI that doesn't help at all!

Food items in the delivery menu are already overpriced to recover commision charges. Benefits under Zomato gold have been eroded with time rendering it useless for food delivery. Then they added platform fee which keeps increasing with time. Now they charge rain surcharge fee even for gold members. It has reached a point where picking the order from the restaurant yourself will save money.",

The food and packaging costs come from the restaurant, GST is applied as per government norms, and the platform and delivery fees help keep things running smoothly for both customers and delivery partners. Tips, of course, are optional. Hope this helps!",

I had raised a complaint regarding a recent order that had serious issues, and I followed up by sending a detailed email to their support team. Unfortunately, even after several days, I have not received any response or acknowledgment. As a regular user of the platform, I expected at least a basic level of customer care and accountability. Ignoring customer concerns not only reflects poor service but also erodes trust in the platform.",

My last 3 orders are delayed by much time. if you speak to both it is hopeless and helpless zomato needs to ensure to manage timely delivery as it was committed at the time of order. otherwise restaurant needs to be penalized, but it is not the case. Not getting call after escalatuon. also most of the time the restaurant number available on app to call restaurant is always invalid. zomato is delivering very poor services these days.",

Today 6th June 2025 I had placed an order and the total cost was rs.204. But I received a call from the vendor informing me that the order I've placed is no longer available and the number of items are out of stock. In the meantime I have received a call from a zomato employee, who was so rude and just unprofessional. The awful thing they cancelled my order without refund.",

I had an issue with a few recent orders from different restaurants, and their team provided a satisfying solution. Kudos to them! I'm upgrading my rating from * to ****. While the food was great, one area for improvement could be providing more awareness to delivery partners about proper food handling. Nonetheless, thanks for serving a good meal! 😊",
