This feature is incredibly helpful. Just for 1700, I was offered a Tata Mineral water bottle, Free Hi-Speed Wifi and most importantly a very comfortable bed, on-time pick up and drop. Mythri Tours and Travels was my operator. These guys were amazing.",

            "content": "I wanted to book a bus ticket from Srikakulam to Chennai, but I couldn’t find any direct options. The RedBus app suggested an alternative route, advising me to get off at Denduluru, claiming it’s just 28 km from Chennai. Based on that suggestion, I booked the ticket. However, I later discovered that Denduluru is actually hundreds of kilometers farther from Chennai. Now, I want to cancel the ticket, but the cancellation option is no longer available. This is quite frustrating and misleading.",

Usually, they just look at the ticket on my phone, but for the KLIA2 to KL Sentral trip, they suddenly required a printed ticket. The app gave no warning, and I was charged RM1 per person to print. The driver was also rude. Suasana Edaran’s 4.7-star rating doesn’t match this poor experience. Please improve communication and train staff to treat passengers better.",

There were no lights, people, or facilities—just complete isolation. It was extremely unsafe, and I feared for my life. When I contacted RedBus, their response was cold and unhelpful. This shows a complete disregard for passenger safety.",

The staff was very rude and unhelpful. They behaved like they were doing us a favor by letting us board. To make things worse, the driver kept stopping unnecessarily,",

The bus was cancelled by the bus operator on 28th Feb. 2025 but it was not communicated to me till the date of the journey. when I reached the pickup location I called the bus operator and he said your bus had been cancelled. I complained to red app customer care but all in vain they all asked to give me a rating after this call only but don't initiate a refund. i did not get my refund till now",

I booked a ticket which did not go through, with a message \"if the ticket is not booked, money will be refunded in some x days\". So after 20 mins I booked another ticket, and next day I got to know red bus booked both the tickets for me for the same passanger on same date between same locations. Great!! What an algorithm And then they could not cancel and refund full money for 1 of the ticket. Hats off to your policies for looting people!",

A few issues I'm gonna emphasize that especially the bus departing location,so the timing is not the same as stated in the app itself. Which is misleading, end up the plan had been delayed. *Also why there isn't a QR code generated ,I paid for the fare and I need to pay another fee for the ticket just to print a QR code.Which I don't get it * I attempted to try giving feedback to the apps but failed.",
