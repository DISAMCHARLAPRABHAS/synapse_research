Many times it also freezes for non-grocery searches as well. And every time the app freezes, I don't see any choice other than to close the app and start the search again. This makes the overall shopping experience really bad.",

I genuinely wanted to give it 5 stars, but I'm rating it 3 due to two major issues: 1. High Data Consumption: If you scroll through the app for about an hour, it can consume around 1.5GB of data, which is quite excessive for a shopping app. 2. Scrolling Bug: Whenever I scroll through items and open a product, hitting the back button takes me to the top of the list instead of where I left off.",

Many items are missing in the order. No proper escalation/ resolution team to address our concerns. I don't think Flipkart has a plan to withdraw their grocery/ kilo memberships. I feel that's the reason the app is so laggy but no resolution from the team.",

This appears to be a development oversight, as it is not intuitive for users. A better approach would be a toggle switch or radio buttons with clearer labels like \"Available\" and \"Not Available.\" As a developer, I hope this feedback helps improve the app. Looking forward to future updates!",

Search not working, i.e. search any configuration of mobile like processor name/screen size etc, it just gives garbage 🗑️. 2. No option for ordered products by configuration i.e. if I want to make list ordering ascending or descending as per screen size, year of launch, RAM, etc, 😂 it's toooooo complex for Flipkart, they can't achieve due to lack of technical expertise.",

I received the wrong products multiple times, and the quality was very poor, especially with the headphones – completely different from what was shown. The return and exchange process is also a hassle. Honestly, this app has let me down. I’ve never faced such issues with Amazon, Ajio, or Myntra – they are far more reliable with better service and product quality. Very disappointed with Flipkart.",

The seller made their profit, and both the brand and Flipkart benefited, but the customer ended up with a faulty product. This is why buying online, especially from Flipkart, is a huge mistake. They sell third-class quality products, and none of their items are reliable.I appeal to everyone never to purchase products from Flipkart.",

Their so-called \"fast delivery\" is a joke! Orders are delivered late, and there is no good communication from their side. In addition to that, their refund process is frustrating too. In case you ever need a refund, get ready to wait eternity. The customer care is pointless, answering with the same pre-defined answers",

The only reason I used flipkart all these years was support even though amazon had better prices and options. And you have taken that away. Everything has to come to an end anyways. It was a good run. Update: Gave it another try after a long time. seems like you have forgotten to deliver my order and the delivery agent just keeps cutting my call. wonderful",

I have been a loyal Flipkart customer for over a decade, and while I had heard complaints about their service online, I never faced any major issues myself—until now. This time, I ordered something significant: a MacBook Air. And what do I get? Endless frustration. My order has been delayed for almost a week without any valid reason. To make matters worse, Flipkart offers no way to track the incident status or view updates from their backend team.",

If that’s the case, why was the order accepted? If I cancel now, I’ll lose the offer, which is unfair after waiting 5 days.

            "content": "Worst experience with Flipkart. This was my first time ordering earbuds from Flipkart on 20th March. The expected delivery date was shown as 4th April. However, on the delivery day, they suddenly updated the status and extended the delivery to 10th April — that’s a 21-day delay! Completely unacceptable. I’m cancelling my order now. Such poor service is disappointing. Amazon handles logistics far better than this. I won’t be ordering from Flipkart again.",

But I am very much disappointed with your Too worst delivery time compared to meesho and amazon online shopping apps. Grocery order cancelled after 3 days just before the delivery date that too amount prepaid order. Playing with customers patience. Chatbot is piss off the customers patience while trying to reach customer care. If you don't develop delivery speed soon your fall down starts. I think There is no quality check also.",
