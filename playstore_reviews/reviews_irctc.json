If a person books ticket for group of 6 after every unpredictable logout he has to keep feeding the same data at every failed cycle of the same transaction/ticket. It seems this is built-in feature to give advantage to licensed agent. How many times a person will keep trying to book the same ticket? This is very advantageous to agents during rush season, specially if you are trying to book last available seats",

Irctc is earning by doing partnerships with other 3rd party booking apps so that they can earn more commission. normal people are facing issues in booking tatkal ticket. initially, it was very easy to book tickets by the lrctc app, but now they won't show the availability also, and every time, shows unable to fetch, and you will be logged out from the app. Why IRCTC shame on you",

The developers have done a shameful job. The government and IRCTC must act or shut it down. It causes stress, wastes time, and steals money without refund. Developers should be ashamed. It",

When i booked within 3 minutes of tatkal time by 11:03, tickets went to waiting list of 122.  This is a definitely a serious issue with IRCTC. And they refund is Rs.70/- , half of it. This is literally looting of money. I just couldn't digest this since this is not the first time looting.",

Ads appear not only within the app but also in notifications, which can be quite annoying. During peak hours like 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, and 11:00 AM, the app becomes slow, and constant ad refreshes worsen the experience. The app should focus on improving performance and reducing distractions for a better user experience.",
