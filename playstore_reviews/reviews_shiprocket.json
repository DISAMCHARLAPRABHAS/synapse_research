They say the seller charges extra because of weight issue, but they can't show the weight proof from the seller.

My package arrived at the destination hub or nearby facility but was not delivered for several more hours — with no clear reason or communication.

Now the package is in my city, but they refused to share the delivery person's number. I chose Air Courier, it shouldn’t take 7 days. Now they’re saying it’ll arrive by EOD on the 16th. Seriously? The customer service is terrible, and the agents are unprofessional and clueless. don't ever try shiprocket if you can't handle late deliveries and unprofessional answers..",
