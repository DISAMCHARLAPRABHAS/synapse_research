There is no real-time tracking, no contact number, no flexibility, and their support is just copy-paste replies with no accountability. We kept writing our concerns, escalated the issue multiple times, and still — no resolution. It feels like once they have your parcel, you lose all control. Their so-called “priority handling” is just false hope.",

To make matters worse, tracking information showed that the parcel had reached its final destination two days prior, yet there was an unexplained delay in delivery. It was only after I lodged a complaint that the item was finally delivered. Such negligence and lack of professionalism are unacceptable and reflect poorly on the service provider.",

Shipment wasn't ready. They haven't even showed up at my door a single time in these 9 days.
