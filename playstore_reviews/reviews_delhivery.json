No updates, no accountability, no proper communication‚Äîjust a complete disaster. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable service, STAY FAR AWAY from this company. I am beyond frustrated",

Instead, it is delivered to my neighboring village, which is 8 km away from my home. I am facing this issue only with the agent named Partha from KR Pete. Until now, I have somehow managed to collect my items from the place where he left them, but not anymore. I have escalated this issue with Amazon as well. All other agents are delivering the item to the doorstep expect him.",

Absolute Fraud Delivery. On top of it, their page very conveniently doesn't show that delivery at all. I have their mail which clearly delivered garbage. Never use Delhivery. My husband lost his Zaara shopping during delivery. Out of 15 products, the top products were stolen, carton sealed. Go for a little expensive delivery service. Be safe.",
