            "content": "waste of money better stick with irctc i recently used the confirm ticket app to book a railway ticket and it turned out to be a complete waste of money the prices are significantly higher compared to booking directly through irctc for example a ticket that costs around 550 for 3 people on irctc was priced at 700 on the ticket confirm app for the exact same journey that s an unnecessary extra charge for no added value i strongly recommend avoiding such third party apps",
